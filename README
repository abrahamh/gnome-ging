Memo:

Starting point for this application was:
=======================================

This is "Ding"
  * a dictionary lookup program for Unix,
  * DIctionary Nice Grep,
  * a Tk based Front-End to [ae]grep, ispell, dict, ...
  * Ding {n} :: thing

Ding contains a program "ding" and a German-English dictionary 
(about 135,000 entries).

=======================================

But Ding has some limitations:
- no nice gnome UI
- only one dictionary
- no support for spelling and thesaurus
- no real unicode support

My idea was to redevelop Ding as gtk application. Add more 
dictionaries and add spelling support as well.

But first I look for similary applications and found 

* g2ding from Oliver Grawert <http://www.grawert.net/software/>

Based on this knowledge, I start to develop gnome-ding.

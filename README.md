gnome ding is a translator and spellchecker for Gtk2/Gnome2. This program
is intended by "ding" (http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/). Also
this program is intended by xsteak (and his spelling limits) and by g2ding

The main intentions of gnome-ding are to provide a offline spellchecker,
based on aspell-dictionarys and a tool for translation (de-en) and a
thesaurus (de).

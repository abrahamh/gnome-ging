- add syntax-highlight for result-window (include better upper-case)
- add thesaurus (de, en)
- update documentations 
- update languages de/es (I need help for it)
- check-in more aspell-languages

-------------------------------------


the thesaurus come from "http://thesaurus.kdenews.org". This
Thesaurus is not very nice. It will not support reletions between
the words like defined in ISO 2788 (or DIN 1463-1)
A better way is to transform the thesaurus, take a look to
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus#Linguistische_Thesauri

HINT: for people who will help to translate:

- example: in dirrectory 'po' you will find a file 'gnome-ding.pot'
  copy this file to 'po/es.po' for spain-translation or to
  'po/it.po' for italy and so on.
- then load this file 'po/es.po' with a tool like 'kbabel' or 'emacs'
  or 'gtranslator' and change the strings.
- then save the file and send this file to the author or distributed
  this file with the package.

- in the same way you should work with the online-documentation,
  make a new subdirectory in './doc/' and translate the '.xml' files

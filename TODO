- add syntax-highlight for result-window (include better upper-case)
- add thesaurus (en, fr, it, br)
- update documentations 
- update languages es/fr/it (I need help for it)

-------------------------------------

the thesaurus come from "http://thesaurus.kdenews.org". This
Thesaurus is not very nice. It will not support reletions between
the words like defined in ISO 2788 (or DIN 1463-1)
A better way is to transform the thesaurus, take a look to
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus#Linguistische_Thesauri

HINT: for people who will help to translate:

- example: in directory 'po' you will find a file 'gnome-ding.pot'
  copy this file to 'po/es.po' for spainsh-translation or to
  'po/it.po' for italian and so on.
- then load this file 'po/es.po' with a tool like 'kbabel' or 'emacs'
  or 'gtranslator' and change the strings.
- then save the file and send this file to the author or distributed
  this file with the package.

- in the same way you should work with the online-documentation,
  make a new subdirectory in './doc/' and translate the '.xml' files

-------------------------------------


HINT: for people who will help to support dict's:

- you can edit the existing dict's, found at /usr/share/dict/*.ding
  please be very careful to protect errors.
  Send a mail to the author, so that the changes can be included
  in the next release.

- if you have found a new language, that will not be supported
  be gnome-ding, then send a email to the author with a link,
  who can be receive a new thesaurus or dict.
  Then the author can include it, or you lock inside the code.
  in main.c you will find macros to save the filename for the
  dict and his state to display it in the selection box.
  in callbacks.c you will found macros to fill this settings into
  the selection-combo-box and macros to select it for actions an
  macros to fill this information into the preferences dialog.
  Typical it is only only programming line for each action and
  languages - so I hope it is simple enought.
